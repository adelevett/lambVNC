```

## Features

- **Agentless** — senders need only TightVNC Server + Windows built-in OpenSSH
- **Browser-based grid** — noVNC-powered 4×3 grid, accessible via any modern browser or RDP
- **Visual change detection** — three-tier pixel diffing (low/medium/high) with configurable alerts and fade timers
- **Encrypted at rest** — VNC passwords stored with AES-256-GCM, admin login hashed with bcrypt
- **Tamper-evident audit log** — SQLite WAL recording who watched whom and when
- **Embedded SSH server** — `ssh2`-powered, no OS-level `sshd` required on the monitoring station
- **Zero build pipeline** — vanilla JavaScript client, no framework, no transpilation

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

| Component | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Node.js 20+** | Monitoring station | 22 LTS recommended |
| **TightVNC Server** | Each sender machine | Listening on port 5900 |
| **OpenSSH Client** | Each sender machine | Built into Windows 10/11 (Settings → Optional Features) |

### Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/lambvnc.git
cd lambvnc
npm install
```

`npm install` automatically vendors the noVNC client library into `client/vendor/novnc/`.

### First Run

```bash
npm start
```

On first run, the server will:

1. **Generate cryptographic keys** — `data/.key` (AES-256), `data/.secret` (JWT), `data/host.key` (SSH Ed25519)
2. **Prompt for an admin password** — hashed with bcrypt and stored in `data/admin.hash`
3. **Create data files** — `data/profiles.json` and `data/audit.db`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Back up `data/.key`, `data/.secret`, and `data/host.key` immediately.**
> Loss of `.key` makes all stored VNC passwords permanently unrecoverable.
> Changing `host.key` triggers SSH host key mismatch warnings on every sender.

### Open the Dashboard

Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` and log in with the password you set.

## Sender Setup

Each monitored Windows machine needs a one-time configuration:

### 1. Install TightVNC Server

Install TightVNC Server and configure it to listen on port 5900.

**Lock TightVNC to loopback only** — the SSH tunnel connects to TightVNC from `127.0.0.1` on the sender machine. Setting TightVNC to accept only loopback connections means it is completely unreachable from the LAN — all VNC access is forced through the LambVNC SSH tunnel.

Open **TightVNC Server → Configuration → Access Control** and check **"Allow only loopback connections"**.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If this box is unchecked, TightVNC is directly reachable over the LAN, bypassing the SSH tunnel and all authentication LambVNC provides. If the box is checked but the wrong option is selected, the tile will show "Security negotiation failed — loopback connections are not enabled".

### 2. Enable OpenSSH Client

Settings → Apps → Optional Features → OpenSSH Client.

### 3. Generate an SSH key pair on the sender

```powershell
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -f C:\Users\<USERNAME>\.ssh\lambvnc_key -N ""
```

### 4. Register the sender in the LambVNC dashboard

In the dashboard sidebar, click **Add Host** and fill in:
- Label, IP, VNC port, VNC password
- Paste the contents of `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\.ssh\lambvnc_key.pub` into the SSH Public Key field

### 5. Copy the generated SSH command

After saving the host, click the **⊘ copy button** next to it in the sidebar. This copies a fully pre-filled SSH command to your clipboard with the correct tunnel port, VNC port, and SSH port already substituted.

Replace `<USERNAME>` with the Windows username on the sender, and `<SERVER-IP>` with the LambVNC machine's IP address as reachable from the sender's network.

### 6. Create a startup task that runs on boot

Paste the copied command into a scheduled task (Trigger: At startup, run as SYSTEM or the sender user). For auto-recovery if the tunnel drops, wrap it in a loop:

```powershell
while ($true) {
    ssh -i C:\Users\<USERNAME>\.ssh\lambvnc_key -N `
        -R 127.0.0.1:<TUNNEL_PORT>:127.0.0.1:<VNC_PORT> `
        sender@<SERVER-IP> -p <SSH_PORT> `
        -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes `
        -o ServerAliveInterval=30 `
        -o ServerAliveCountMax=3 `
        -o StrictHostKeyChecking=accept-new
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
}
```

> [!WARNING]
> Always use `127.0.0.1` explicitly in the `-R` flag — never `localhost`.
> Windows OpenSSH may bind to IPv6 loopback (`[::1]`) when `localhost` is used, silently breaking the tunnel.

The startup task can be deployed via Group Policy for zero-touch provisioning.

## Configuration

Edit `config.json` in the project root. All fields are optional with sensible defaults:

```json
{
  "serverPort": 3000,
  "sshPort": 2222,
  "basePort": 5910,
  "tls": false,
  "sessionTtl": 28800,
  "fadeDuration": 15,
  "reconnectInterval": 5,
  "reconnectRetries": 3,
  "maxHosts": 12,
  "rateLimitWindow": 900,
  "rateLimitMax": 10,
  "auditRetentionDays": 90
}
```

| Field | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `serverPort` | `3000` | Dashboard HTTP/WS port (1024–65535) |
| `sshPort` | `2222` | Embedded SSH server port for sender tunnels (1024–65535) |
| `basePort` | `5910` | First port in the sequential bridge range (1024–65535) |
| `tls` | `false` | Enable HTTPS/WSS. Requires `tlsCert` and `tlsKey` |
| `tlsCert` | — | Absolute path to PEM certificate (required if `tls: true`) |
| `tlsKey` | — | Absolute path to PEM private key (required if `tls: true`) |
| `sessionTtl` | `28800` | JWT session lifetime in seconds (8 hours) |
| `fadeDuration` | `15` | Alert border fade duration in seconds (1–300) |
| `reconnectInterval` | `5` | Seconds between tunnel reconnection attempts (1–60) |
| `reconnectRetries` | `3` | Max retries before cell shows "disconnected" (1–10) |
| `maxHosts` | `12` | Maximum monitored sessions (hard cap: 12) |
| `rateLimitWindow` | `900` | Login rate limit window in seconds (15 min) |
| `rateLimitMax` | `10` | Max login attempts per window per IP |
| `auditRetentionDays` | `90` | Audit log entries older than this are pruned on startup |

Invalid configuration causes the server to **exit immediately with a clear error** — it will never start with bad config.

## Deployment Models

### Localhost via RDP (Recommended)

Run the server and browser on the same dedicated Windows machine. Administrators access the grid via RDP. No TLS needed — browsers treat `localhost` as a secure context. SSH tunnels encrypt all sender↔server traffic. RDP encrypts the administrator's session.

### Network Browser Access

Serve the dashboard over the LAN for access from any device. Requires TLS with a trusted certificate — typically an internal CA deployed via Group Policy or MDM. Set `tls: true` with `tlsCert` and `tlsKey` in `config.json`.

---

## Change Detection

LambVNC detects visual changes on monitored screens using client-side pixel diffing:

1. Each VNC canvas is downscaled to 64×64 grayscale (500× reduction from 1080p)
2. Pixel-by-pixel comparison against the previous frame
3. If the percentage of changed pixels exceeds a threshold, an alert fires

### Tiers

| Tier | Area | Distance | Color | Typical trigger |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **High** | 5% | 10 | 🔴 Red | Any detectable change |
| **Medium** | 10% | 20 | 🟠 Orange | Moderate activity |
| **Low** | 15% | 30 | 🔵 Blue | Large UI changes |

Alerts snap the cell border to full opacity, then fade over `fadeDuration` seconds (configurable). Retriggering resets the timer. Per-cell or global mute is available.

## API

All endpoints except login require a valid JWT cookie.

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/` | Dashboard |
| `GET` | `/login` | Login page |
| `POST` | `/login` | Authenticate (returns JWT cookie) |
| `POST` | `/logout` | Clear session |
| `GET` | `/api/hosts` | List hosts with tunnel status |
| `POST` | `/api/hosts` | Add host |
| `PUT` | `/api/hosts/:id` | Update host |
| `DELETE` | `/api/hosts/:id` | Remove host |
| `GET` | `/api/profiles` | List monitoring profiles |
| `POST` | `/api/profiles` | Create profile |
| `PUT` | `/api/profiles/:id` | Update profile |
| `DELETE` | `/api/profiles/:id` | Delete profile |
| `GET` | `/health` | Server state (tunnels, sessions, uptime) |
| `WS` | `/ws/:hostId` | VNC WebSocket bridge |
| `WS` | `/control` | Tunnel status push channel |

## Security

| Threat | Mitigation |
|---|---|
| Screen content interception | SSH tunnel encrypts all sender→server traffic |
| Unauthorized dashboard access | bcrypt + JWT + rate limiting |
| VNC password extraction | AES-256-GCM encryption at rest |
| Key leakage | Keys in `data/` (gitignored), not in config |
| Direct WS bypass | Bridges bound to `127.0.0.1` only |
| Session hijacking | HTTP-only cookies, JWT expiration |
| Audit tampering | SQLite WAL ACID compliance |
| Brute force | bcrypt cost 12 + 10 attempts / 15 min |

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the full threat model and design rationale.

---

## Testing

```bash
node --test test.js
```

The test suite covers 13 suites / 51 tests including:
- AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt correctness
- Network binding (bridges are localhost-only)
- WebSocket upgrade authentication gating
- bcrypt login + rate limiting
- CSP headers
- Profile backup-on-write
- Audit log schema and concurrency
- Config validation (fail loud)
- Route auth surface
- Host CRUD → health reflection
- Port collision detection
- **SSH sender authentication** (end-to-end key verification)
- Event bus contract
